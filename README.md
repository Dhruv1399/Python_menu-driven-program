# Python_menu-driven-program
Problem - Convert OS based program into a menu driven program using Python code which will execute required user query when user gives the input as text.

This program has been an outcome of 4 days of my journey in learning python.
I have used os and pyttsx3 modules in this program.

As of now, the program has been developed to execute the query given (input as text) by the user for opening -  
  Various browser such as Chrome, Firefox and MS Edge
  Various Music/Video player such as VLC and Windows Media Player
  Notepad/Text Editor

It will also speak to you whatever the program is doing or wants the user to do.
It will also give appropriate error message and also quit/exit the program when the users comands to do so.
