# Python_menu-driven-program
The program code is in file "Menu Driven Program"
This has been outcome of 4 days of my journey in learning Python under IIEC and trainer Mr. Vimal Dagga

Problem - Convert OS based program into a menu driven program using Python code which will execute required user query when user gives the input as text.

The program as of now will open applications like browsers - Chrome, Firefox and MS Edge - music/video players - VLC, Windows Media Player - and Notepad/Text Editor. Even if the user wants to use browser, the program will ask for the name of the browser and same goes for music/video player.
The program will take input as text from user and will execute the query. 
It will also speak to the user and ask user for command/query and will tell you that it is opening that particular operation.

The user will get appropriate result even if the query is spelled wrong and will also quit/exit the program when the user tells to do so.
